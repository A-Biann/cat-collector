For 2023 aoop group project

## Cat and Dog Collector App:
The aim of this app is to encourage people to spend more time outdoors, collecting pictures of cute cats and dogs they encounter in their daily lives.

### For the AI Model:
When users capture photos of cats or dogs with their phone's camera, they can upload these photos to the app. The app's backend incorporates an AI model for identifying cat and dog breeds and removing backgrounds. It can save the silhouettes of cats and dogs as PNG files, allowing users to keep them.

### For the App:
In addition to the features mentioned above, the app will randomly assign attributes and beautiful backgrounds to the collected images. This enables users to experience the joy of collecting digital cards and share them with friends. There may also be a possibility of adding a multiplayer battle feature in the future.

## Programming Framework:
- App Design: Flutter
- AI Model: PyTorch
